         I started writting about random stuff, post summer-twenty twenty four to improve my articulations, under the umbrella of 'the placement prep'. I have penned down (not literally, i write in .doc) exactly 54 times, totalling word count of 24613 as of twenty-first August, 2025. Quite a few times i have resolved to write daily, clearly i have failed. Tho much of content can't be shared in open internet, but some of it can. So, after college ended, with ample amount of FREE time. I decided to create this website, but each time i tried, the code failed at the same spot. <br /> My mechanical degree and chatgpt gave up. 
        <br /> Halfway through august, with few days in hand before i leave home on train to Hazrat Nizamuddin Station for my job, my brain had me telling this simple task had to be completed. So, this time, taking the simpler path, i got the website up and running in few days with git-repos, chat-gpt and vercel.

          Now, the website is like a new toy for seven year old, to play with. You may find random component(not needed to the website), quotes, photos, with no correlation or pattern what-so-ever. I intend to keep it as my source of timepass and hence no advertisement as of yet.

          The name <i>kaayam</i>(qaayam) means ठहरना, ठहराव। arabic/persian word. <br /> I found the word when once i texted my friend "dunia kaayam h ishq ke wajah se, kuch toh sachai hogi isme". My curious mind wanted to know the literal meaning of the word - my heart loved the meaning, then, with extension, the word.

          The icon is collage of three frames from a fairly popular and good movie <i>la la land</i>. Liking a rom-com is actually extremely subjective. When you watch a WW2 film, everyone is fairly at same level, because the majority has never actually seen war except in screens. But rom-com - well, people have lived that stuff, so one is at the same level. Hence, a simple sweet rom-com is usually hit, as it resonates with masses. A complicated one, doesn't. la la land along with other elements had realistic ending, again resonating with mass. I like <i>materialist</i> for a very particular response in one of the dialougues.
          <br /> Personally i don't like rom-com, full of cliche, predictable, normie stuff, or they sell delusional hope. But i like these two films. <br /> so yes romcom - subjective

          One more thing, if you find blog starting with Day-XX | Date. It's because it was written on that date and the day-n signifies it was n-th day of me writting in my .doc.
