Day 57 | 14-09-25

Gurgaon

Let’s start with basics. It’s a pathetic city. That’s it.
Three weeks have gone by since I have stepped into NZM station, but it feels longer than that. Are systems set into place? No, still looking for flat. And flatmate. People, Although recently I have convinced myself to live alone.
Workouts are quite regular and diet apart from office hours, should definitely be questioned.

Went to watch The Godfather (1972) alone, sixteen kilometres from my place, for a 1030 show. Couldn’t find anyone interested in this 180min watch. I had to - otherwise what’s the point of being a guy living away from your family, if you don’t go to watch your wish listed cinema at midnight. There were no subtitles, though I surprised myself for being able to grasp most of it, they were required for better understanding of the film.

Grateful for being in actually a good enterprise, with great work culture, a welcoming team, their roster service, delicious healthy bowl and subway sandwiches. Sweet Poison, four-year senior amex colleague coined the phrase. The amex culture, however ‘chill’ work you find, always go Up and Beyond, seek work, dedicate hours, deliver impact for growth. 
The products are interesting, the case reviews were intriguing, the work seems somewhat exciting. I am, as of now, not in any position of retort or complain, rather opposite, grateful.

Last week, a senior leader had his visit here from US, his name is Dwaipin Ghosh. Btw, I have acted rather extrovertedly as per my standards, building rapo with many colleagues. So, with series of few short conversations, I have made a pact-deal with DP. I am going to visit New York, and he is going to give me treat in his favourite restaurant. It’s a thai one, which apparently serves delicious fish dishes. And for some reason, I am absolutely certain, this event will take place in upcoming years, two years, five years, seven? Not sure. But certainly,

I don’t like the dust here, the traffic was expected, the road is definitely not fine. They didn’t even bother to name the areas, numbers with sector as their prefix are dictating maps of Gurugram, that’s how character less, spoiled kid this city looks to me. What I haven’t been able to continue here properly are books. I need to get paperbacks into a system. The days are faster, nights are quicker, weekends are short, (although I suspect any-length of weekend would seem short to our(my) greedy, curious mind with delusional dream and chasing arts).

The more i find myself, the more i recognise myself as a child. Or it could be just be confirmation bias of a conversation long back. But, i don't thing that's the case when i look at the sane people around me. Me switching topics, adruptly in above paras is just one of the evidence of my conjecture. I think most people are child in some sense, with layers of *not* anger, calm or maturity but routine, identity, society, money, status, gurgaon, mumbai. When that child pops out, maybe conscience does too, chaos of society surrenders and allows the child's dance, dreaming of his own childhood under the layers. And maybe child is a wrong word for above discourse, *living* is the word beneath. A child simply lives - cries, laughs, sleeps, plays and shit here and there.
