It’s Saturday, mid of December, a twenty-one year is sleeping with his parents, on a huge old bed, dim ochre yellow light finding its way through layers of hanged cloths, window panes and curtain, in a small two BHK apartment at a striving city on the west coast of India, sister of the city of dream, blessed with moderate temp, effortlessly tucked in one blanket.
its 630am, the alarm goes off, I oddly find myself to be first one to notice it, but I follow the regime of being the last to get up. Next when my eye-lid decided to take a break, my mother was in front of me with a glass of lemon water. My brain suddenly caught hold reality, we are going to visit Siddhivinayak. The clock strikes seven

Why is Siddhivinayak so famous, revered and iconic.

Ganpati who fulfils wishes, *Navasacha Ganapati* that’s the nickname given to the Ganpati there, built on 1801.

> Ganpati as Siddhi-vinayak literally means:
Siddhi = success, spiritual power, accomplishment
Vinayak = remover of obstacles

*"The Siddhivinayak Temple’s spiritual aura begins with its unique and powerful idol. Carved from a single black stone, it features a rare right-bent trunk—considered especially potent in Ganesh worship—along with diamond-studded eyes that enhance its divine presence. Behind the main idol sit Riddhi and Siddhi, the deities of prosperity and accomplishment, completing a sacred combination that is found in very few Ganesh temples. This distinctive iconography gives Siddhivinayak a rare spiritual depth and magnetic appeal.*

*Historically, the temple’s reverence is rooted in a simple yet profound story. Built in 1801 by a childless couple who later miraculously conceived, the shrine quickly earned a reputation as a fertility-granting place of worship in early Mumbai. As the city grew, the temple evolved into its spiritual centre, drawing people from all walks of life. The tradition of visiting on Tuesdays—Ganpati’s day—soon transformed into massive weekly footfalls, strengthening its status as a deeply trusted and accessible place of devotion."*

There couldn't have been any better place than Mumbai. Siddhivinayak resonates with the very character of Mumbai, turning it into not just a place of worship but a symbol of resilience and aspiration.

While sipping the lemon water, I got the news that one of mother’s childhood friend, who at present is in Mumbai for her husband’s cancer treatment is going to meet us there.
We were out of our apartment sharp at 730am, I got impressed by father’s navigation and memory skills as he rejected google maps. Apparently Siddhivinayak is quite near arabian sea, just below mahim arena.

We had a very peaceful yet powerful workship of bappa. Tanushree, maa’s friend was quite late, but we managed to have a lovely uthappam breakfast at our good old go-to restaurant near the temple. A notable part of the journey would be the novel “FountainHead” by Ayn Rand found its flow and structure in my conscious. I continued the novel till lunch and post lunch, till I fell asleep just to ruthlessly shaking me awake at 5 pm.

P.S. The photo above is definately not anywhere near dadar. it's a small mandir, in some hilltop of western ghats, where we reached after exhausting trek in scorching heat.
